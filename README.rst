====================
Django Token Auth
====================

This is a small reusable django app to restrict access
to selected URLs or authenticate a user using unique
token/hash URLs. It requires a functional installation of
Django_ 1.0 or newer and provides a useful way of limiting
access without creating users.

For installation and usage instructions, see the included ``docs`` 
directory.
