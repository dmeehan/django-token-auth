====================
Django Token Auth
====================

This is a small reusable django app to restrict access
to selected URLs or authenticate a user using unique
token/hash URLs. It requires a functional installation of
Django 1.0 or newer and provides a useful way of limiting
access without creating users.

For installation instructions, see the file "INSTALL.rst" in
this directory and for more information read the docs in the
``'docs'`` directory.
