====================
Django Token Auth
====================

NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME YET... ALMOST THERE...

This is a small reusable django app to restrict access
to selected URLs using unique token/hash URLs. It requires
a functional installation of Django 1.0 or newer and provides
a useful way of limiting access without creating users.

For installation instructions, see the file "INSTALL.txt" in this
directory; for instructions on how to use this application, and on
what it provides, see the file "overview.txt" in the "docs/"
directory.
