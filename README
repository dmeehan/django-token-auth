====================
Django Token Auth
====================

This is a small reusable django app to restrict access
to selected URLs using unique token/hash URLs. It requires
a functional installation of Django 1.0 or newer and provides
a useful way of limiting access without creating users.

For installation instructions, see the file "INSTALL" in this
directory.

** coming soon we promise **
For instructions on how to use this application, and on
what it provides, see the file "overview.txt" in the "docs/"
directory.
